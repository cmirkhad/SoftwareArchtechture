## About
The following application is a mid-term project for Back-End development course. Project includes database with postgreSQL, REST API using String Boot Java.
The main purpose of the application is to store tracks from users(submitters) and provide possibility to listen to for all other users soon. <br> The idea of the application is pretty worn out, but, still, it has provided me a great opporitunity for developing my programming skills.
